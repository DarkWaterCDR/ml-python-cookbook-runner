### Ascii to ipynb
This folder contains notebooks autogenerated from the asciidoc chapters, and makes them reproducibly runnable in a docker image. This lets authors quickly validate code from specific chapters with the need for copy+paste or any additional github repos.  

To avoid bloat/messy git diffs, the notebooks are committed to this repo - but instructions for generating a Python notebook for any given chapter is below.

#### Generating and Running Chapters as Python Notebooks
In order to generate Python notebooks from asciidocs, you need to install the following command line utility with `npm`:

```bash
npm i asciidoctor
npm i asciidoctor-jupyter
```

Then run the converter using `generate_notebook.sh` passing the chapter as an argument:
```bash
./generate_notebook.sh 08
```

Finally, to run the notebooks using Python 3.10 with docker, we can build an image and run a container with this working directory mounted as a volume:
```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t machine-learning-cookbook .
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace -p 8888:8888 machine-learning-cookbook 
```

Go to http://localhost:8888 to open notebooks and run them (you may need the token that's printed out in the terminal).
